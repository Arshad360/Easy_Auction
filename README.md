## Challenges:
Well I have faced various problems throughout my journey of building this web application. 
First problem i faced in # step: 1, was on login procedure. I have some issued regarding the password authentication. I had to watch a youtube tutorial for me to solve it. 
In # step: 2, I had several issue on the project deployment in django server. It did not working for some time. Because of the path mismatch. After that my footer was creating problem as it was ppositioned in absolute. But at last I made it fixed so that it looks good.
In #step: 3, my images was not deploying in the server. It was storing in the database, but the image url was not been able to retrieve. I didn't be able to solve this problem.
In #step: 7, I was trying for almost 1 day to deploy my web application to heroku. But I have failed multiple time. My wsgi file was showing a error with "no module", I tried stackoverflow but unable to get any fruitful result.
